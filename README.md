# bootable-usb-media-manager
Makes easy to manage Windows Installation media files in the bootable USB.

# the scenario
I have a bootable usb which has installation medias of bunch of operating systems in it (windows). All the OS files has own folder -of course- and when I want to install one, I move the existing installation medias to its folder and move the new one to the root directory of the USB.

this is the place where the project useful. It scans the root directory, and read the media files (extract the info of them) and I select the OS I wanted, it move the old files to its folder (with a question, or you can create new one) and moves the new ones to the root directory.
